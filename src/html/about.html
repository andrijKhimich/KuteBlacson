                <p>A charismatic visionary and transformational teacher, Kute Blackson offers a fresh, bold look at
                  spiritual
                  awareness for
                  a whole new generation. Born in Ghana, West Africa, Kute’s multicultural upbringing as the child of a
                  Japanese mother
                  and a Ghanaian father has spanned four different continents. His unique lineage lay the foundation for
                  his
                  approach to
                  breaking down barriers and unlocking an individual’s true gifts and greatness.</p>

                <p>Though Kute was raised all over the world, he had always dreamed of life in America. As if by
                  kismet, he won a green
                  card just after finishing school in London. He came to America alone just months later, with no
                  connections or
                  prospects. When Kute arrived in Los Angeles, all he had to his name were two suitcases and the dream
                  of seeking out the
                  spiritual and self-help icons who had inspired him when he was a boy.</p>
                <p>Kute quickly learned that the “outside-in” approach favored by so many in the personal development
                  space had to become
                  an inside-out approach. So he decided to create his own method—a process that liberates the
                  individual and the true self
                  at the core and then pushes those gifts outward into the universe. This helps the individual get in
                  touch with who they
                  really are. It is a process of breaking free—so that the individual can live, give, and share the
                  truest expression of
                  their self. This is what Kute calls “Liberated Living.”</p>

                <p>People tell me that I have a unique perspective.</p>
                <p>That I see things differently.</p>
                <p>When you were born, you were perfect and free. But then life happens. And you learn to develop
                  survival mechanisms that
                  disconnect you from your essence. You develop layers that cover up that perfect soul you were born
                  with. These layers
                  keep you from being who you really are and creating the life that you truly want.</p>
                <p>My work is about reconnecting YOU back to your true source. It isn’t simply about getting more
                  money, better sex and
                  more "stuff".</p>
                <p>Although I am renowned for helping thousands of people achieve those things and much more.</p>
                <p>It’s ultimately about getting more YOU.</p>
                <p>I believe that when you connect to YOU, you will literally shine, attracting your deepest heart’s
                  longing — be it
                  overflowing abundance, juicy relationships, profound recognition — you name it.</p>
                <p>As you connect to who you really are, you access a source of freedom that’s authentic and
                  infinite, not determined by
                  anything outside of yourself. Then you become truly powerful.</p>
                <p>You are able to enter the world with a courage and boldness to fulfill your destiny.</p>
                <p>My work helps you get in touch with “WHO” you really are and then shows you how to live that
                  practically in the real
                  world. It is about living connected to the deepest truth of who you are beyond your conditioning,
                  so that you are able
                  to make life choices that come from the clarity of your true essence.</p>
                <p>This is a new paradigm of spirituality for a new generation.</p>
                <p>This is Liberated Living.</p>
